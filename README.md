# Reinforcement-Guided Pretraining: A General Framework for Internally Aligned Language Models Without Human Feedback

This work introduces a new alignment paradigm that integrates reinforcement signals directly into the pretraining phase of large language models (LLMs), removing the need for human feedback or reward modeling. The framework, called RGP (Reinforcement-Guided Pretraining), aligns language models toward helpful, harmless, and honest (HHH) behaviors while improving efficiency and scalability.

# Problem
Most current alignment methods like RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) are:
- Expensive due to reliance on human annotations.
- Inflexible and separate from pretraining.
- Challenged by scaling and generalization limitations in complex scenarios.

#  Solution
The authors propose RGP, a unified framework that:
- Embeds reward signals into pretraining using synthetic reward functions.
- Enables scalable alignment without costly human intervention.
- Uses a curriculum-based reward schedule that optimizes for helpfulness, truthfulness, and harmlessness in tandem with language modeling.
- Builds self-supervised reward models grounded in behavior alignment objectives.

# Results
- RGP models outperform baseline LLMs and RLHF-based methods across HHH benchmarks.
- Achieves better generalization with reduced supervision cost.
- Supports modular reward composition, enabling fine-grained policy shaping during training.
