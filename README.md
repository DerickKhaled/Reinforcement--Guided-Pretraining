# Reinforcement-Guided Pretraining: A General Framework for Internally Aligned Language Models Without Human Feedback

# Paper Summary

ðŸ›‘ Problem:
Most existing LLM alignment approaches, like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on expensive, post-training interventions involving human-annotated data. This not only increases cost and time but also leads to misalignment between pretrained knowledge and downstream behavior, especially in safety-critical or general-purpose applications. The separation between capability learning and alignment creates conflict between objectives and undermines trust and explainability in real-world deployments.

âœ… Solution:
Reinforcement-Guided Pretraining (RGP) introduces a new alignment paradigm by embedding synthetic reward signals directly into the pretraining loop. This enables intrinsic alignment as the model learns both language and behavior simultaneously. Instead of relying on external feedback, RGP uses internal metrics such as:

- Logical validity
- Self-consistency
- Information coherence

These synthetic rewards guide the model toward desirable behavior from the ground up. RGP combines Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with multi-objective Reinforcement Learning to create LLMs that are self-aligned, explainable, and more scalable than RLHF-based alternatives â€” eliminating the need for preference data or separate alignment phases.
